Sometimes I want to do a cross-set trade with another person on Steam.  It would help if I knew which sets are common between us, so that I can easily filter through their inventory without going through hundreds of pages.  

This script requires that both people have their inventory set to public. 



Run using

    node findcommon.js 76561197984170060 76561197984170060
